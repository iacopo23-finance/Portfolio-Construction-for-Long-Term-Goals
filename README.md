This paper explores an integrated framework for long-term portfolio construction, combining Modern Portfolio Theory, systematic capital accumulation plans,
and Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed approach accounts for real-world constraints such as taxation, transaction costs, and annual rebalancing, assessing the
probability of achieving predefined capital goals over a 20-year horizon. Results provide practical insights for long-term investors and financial planners, offering a
probabilistic evaluation of success rates under different market scenarios.
